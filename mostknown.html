<h1>Elon Musk </h1>
<p class = "info">
    Electric cars. Space rockets. Residential solar power. Any one of Elon Musk’s undertakings could overwhelm the average person, but not the 45-year-old Musk. His seemingly superhuman drive has produced spectacular results: Tesla is now worth over $50 billion, while SpaceX has successfully demonstrated reusable rocket technology. But he expects the same superhuman performance from those around him, making him a tough boss to work for. His latest endeavour? Driven by worry that artificial intelligence will supplant humanity, he’s working on a project to meld people’s brains with powerful computers.

    <h1>Jeff Bezos </h1>
    <p class = "info">
        TIME’s 1999 person of the year is even more influential today. Then an upstart looking to bring e-commerce mainstream largely through online book sales, Bezos’ Amazon is remaking the retail industry in its own image. Not content to dominate that business, Amazon is leading the charge in artificial intelligence with its Alexa software, while big tech firms from Netflix to Spotify have come to rely on its Amazon Web Services cloud computing platform. Bezos has made big side bets of his own, founding private spaceflight company Blue Origin and buying The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million    </p>

    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg </h1>
    <p class = "info">
        The 32-year-old Facebook CEO took Facebook from campus experiment to a social network of unprecedented scale and size. Not content with Facebook’s nearly 2 billion monthly users, Zuckerberg now says he’s on a mission to connect the whole world. That outlandish goal seems at least a little more possible today than, say, 10 years ago. But he’s facing plenty of challenges along the way. Case in point: The rise of “fake news,” digital misinformation campaigns driven by politics or profit. Given Facebook’s incredible content-spreading power, how Zuckerberg deals with these issues will have tremendous real-world impact across the planet.</div>
