    <h1>Elon Musk </h1>
    <p class="info">
        Electric cars. Space rockets. Residential solar power. Any one of Elon Musk’s undertakings could overwhelm the
        average person, but not the 45-year-old Musk. His seemingly superhuman drive has produced spectacular results:
        Tesla is now worth over $50 billion, while SpaceX has successfully demonstrated reusable rocket technology. But
        he expects the same superhuman performance from those around him, making him a tough boss to work for. His
        latest endeavour? Driven by worry that artificial intelligence will supplant humanity, he’s working on a project
        to meld people’s brains with powerful computers.

    <h1>Jeff Bezos </h1>
    <p class="info">
        TIME’s 1999 person of the year is even more influential today. Then an upstart looking to bring e-commerce
        mainstream largely through online book sales, Bezos’ Amazon is remaking the retail industry in its own image.
        Not content to dominate that business, Amazon is leading the charge in artificial intelligence with its Alexa
        software, while big tech firms from Netflix to Spotify have come to rely on its Amazon Web Services cloud
        computing platform. Bezos has made big side bets of his own, founding private spaceflight company Blue Origin
        and buying The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million </p>

    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg </h1>
    <p class="info">
        As CEO of Apple, one of the world’s most valuable brands, Tim Cook has nearly unmatched influence over the
        technology world. Anything Apple does is bound to be copied by a seemingly endless number of rivals, meaning his
        choices will reverberate far beyond One Infinite Loop. Today, Apple is rumored to be experimenting with
        everything from advanced artificial intelligence to augmented reality and self-driving vehicles. Given Apple’s
        role as tastemaker extraordinaire, how Cook decides to move forward with any one of these projects will shape
        the future of the consumer technology landscape.</p></div>
